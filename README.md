# GRDI-AMR Training Resources

## Training in contextual data curation using the GRDI-AMR specification

This repository supports training workshops and self-guided learning in the use of the [GRDI-AMR contextual data specification](https://github.com/cidgoh/GRDI_AMR_One_Health). It provides lecture slides, worked examples, exercises, and guidance documents to help participants learn how to curate, validate, and harmonize antimicrobial resistance (AMR) contextual data using the GRDI-AMR framework.

The GRDI-AMR specification was developed to support “One Health” genomic surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Canada, spanning human health, agriculture, food and environmental data streams. Genomic surveillance of pathogens requires high quality sequence data as well as well structured contextual data. Contextual data is the sample, laboratory, clinical, epidemiological, and methods information that enables the interpretation of sequence data. One Health initiatives often involve data streams from different sources, agencies, sectors, and information management systems, and because the data is structured in different ways it is often difficult to harmonize and integrate. By structuring contextual data using community standards such as minimum information checklists and ontologies, this information can be more easily understood and used by both humans and computers, and can be more easily reused for different types of analyses.

This training material is designed to make it easier for new users and data providers to understand the principles behind the standard and apply it consistently.

# GRDI_AMR_One_Health
  Genomic surveillance using a One Health approach is a powerful tool for understanding and tracking how pathogens affecting human health evolve and spread. Genomic surveillance of pathogens requires high quality sequence data as well as well structured contextual data. Contextual data is the sample, laboratory, clinical, epidemiological, and methods information that enables the interpretation of sequence data. One Health initiatives often involve data streams from different sources, agencies, sectors, and information management systems, and because the data is structured in different ways it is often difficult to harmonize and integrate. By structuring contextual data using community standards such as minimum information checklists and ontologies, this information can be more easily understood and used by both humans and computers, and can be more easily reused for different types of analyses. 

  The Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Genomics Research and Development Initiative (AMR-GRDI) uses a genomics-based approach to understand how food production contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance of human health concern, and explore strategies for reducing antimicrobial resistance in food production systems. The AMR-GRDI is a component of the Federal Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance and Use in Canada, and involves data streams from five federal departments and agencies spanning human health, agriculture, the environment, and food regulation.

  To better harmonize AMR-GRDI contextual data across sectors and agencies, the Metadata Harmonization Working Group has developed an ontology-based One Health AMR data standard for foodborne pathogens, which provides standardized fields, pick lists of controlled vocabulary and prescribed formats for the harmonized capture of contextual data. The standardized fields are based on community standards such as NCBIâ€™s combined Pathogen and Environmental attribute package derived from internationally agreed upon Minimal Data for Matching (MDM) standards, as well as applicable fields from different MIxS packages (Genomic Standards Consortium). The data standard will also be harmonized with recently developed standards (e.g. One Health Enteric Package v1.0: Expanded and Standardized Metadata for Enteric Genomic Epidemiology in the U.S, and the Food MIxS package). The AMR-GRDI standard is implemented via a spreadsheet-based data collection instrument (i.e. metadata template) and accompanying Field and Term reference guides (which provide definitions and additional specific guidance) and this curation SOP.
